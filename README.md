# ardoPostgreSQL

PostgreSQL Database connector for the OutSystems Platform.

This allows you to integrate with a PostgreSQL database in your OutSystems Platform as easily as you can with the built-in database connectors.

This is a project built with the Database Connector SDK available since OutSystems Platform 9.0.0.6. The SDK has Limited Availability and therefore requires OutSystems approval. Please reach out to OutSystems support and open a support ticket (https://www.outsystems.com/supportportal/) requesting the necessary approval.

This is a personal project, not supported by OutSystems.
